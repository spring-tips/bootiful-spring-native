## Basics with Buildpacks
* traditional  
  * at some point i start talking about buildpacks. let's see if i can copy and paste the buildpacks segment from kubernetes native java video? when i start talking about buildpacks, i introduce it in the pom.xml, but maybe i could then jump to the kubernetes-native-java segment?
* reactive (i did this one twice in the video, so skip to the end of the video and work backwarsd to the beginning. i scrapped the entire first take)

## Local Builds 
* Maven
* Gradle 

## Testing 
* check out that we have test binaries for both the gradle and Maven apps

## AOT 
* understanding what it does with spring.factories
* future possibilities 

## Hints 
* Reflection
* Resources
* Serialization
